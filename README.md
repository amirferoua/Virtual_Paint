# Virtual_Paint

In this project I have used opencv library to code a "virtual" Paint.

Once you have found the color of the object or objects to be used for painting, 
just edit the myColors variable for Virtual Paint to detect them.
When you run it, the webcam is activated. Moving the object around will paint
its path on the displayed video.
